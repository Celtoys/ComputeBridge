 * macroid()    reads the next token (C identifier) into tokenbuf.
 *              If it is a #defined macro, it is expanded, and
 *              macroid() returns TRUE, otherwise, FALSE.

 * scanstring() Reads a string from the input stream, calling
 *              a user-supplied function for each character.
 *              This function may be output() to write the
 *              string to the output file, or save() to save
 *              the string in the work buffer.
 * scannumber() Reads a C numeric constant from the input stream,
 *              calling the user-supplied function for each
 *              character.  (output() or save() as noted above.)
 * save()       Save one character in the work[] buffer.
 * savestring() Saves a string in malloc() memory.
 * getfile()    Initialize a new FILEINFO structure, called when
 *              #include opens a new file, or a macro is to be
 *              expanded.
 * Getmem()     Get a specified number of bytes from malloc memory.
 * output()     Write one character to stdout (calling Putchar) --
 *              implemented as a function so its address may be
 *              passed to scanstring() and scannumber().
 * lookid()     Scans the next token (identifier) from the input
 *              stream.  Looks for it in the #defined symbol table.
 *              Returns a pointer to the definition, if found, or NULL
 *              if not present.  The identifier is stored in tokenbuf.
 * defnedel()   Define enter/delete subroutine.  Updates the
 *              symbol table.
 * get()        Read the next byte from the current input stream,
 *              handling end of (macro/file) input and embedded
 *              comments appropriately.  Note that the global
 *              instring is -- essentially -- a parameter to get().
 * cget()       Like get(), but skip over TOK_SEP.
 * unget()      Push last gotten character back on the input stream.
